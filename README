Data-Validate-MySQL version 0.03
================================

This module encapsulates functions that help validate data that will
be inserted into a MySQL database (http://mysql.com/).  All current
data types are supported.

For example, if you have a date in ISO-ish format, and want to make
sure it will insert properly, you can just call is_date() on it.

This code covers a lot of different data types, some of which are better
documented than others.  If you run into something that doesn't match
up between this module and MySQL's current behavior, please let me know
